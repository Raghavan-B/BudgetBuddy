       "' be \\nentered in the revenue column.  \\nNow as an expense . You are left with 80% of thy \\nearnings. How to divide? Some experts recommended to do so:   \\n 28 a) 50% spend all the necessary expenditures (food, \\nutilities, transportation  costs, clothing, etc.),  \\nb) 30% of the things like - Internet, cable TV, restaurants, \\ntickets to the theater s, concerts, books, hobbies, etc. t. \\nt.). \\nDistribution of a particular group are parts of the budget \\nso as you need , such as utilities, food, etc.  just like do -well \\nwith a second group of budget.  \\nThen you start to compile forecasts, articles spending \\nand what you plan to buy in the near future and how much it \\npays around. Try spending zoom in revenue. So, you gradually \\nlearn to feel, where you can spend  more money, but where you \\nneed to save and why.  \\nEveryone has a different understanding of quality of \\nlife. Som e, maybe you can not imagine their life without a night \\nclub visits and restaurants, but solid, perfectly sufficient for a \\nparty at home. Therefor e, if you are going to arrange your \\nfinances and save, then specialized for what you like and which \\nyou prefer. Experts believe that in no case should not abandon \\nthe basic satisfaction  - a roof over you r head, food, clothing, \\netc. May refuse only on what does not belong, essential goods \\nlist. For example, you\\'re accustomed to eating breakfast \\nsandwich with eggs, but if you do it will convert to something  \\n 29 else, or out of it, your standard of living will change very \\nmuch? What conclusions can be done? We are  looking for the \\nsame quality, only much cheaper.  \\nSummary  - essentials of personal finance  \\nThe scope of personal financial planning covers different  \\naspects of your life:  earning, saving, e xpenses , budgeting, \\ntaxes, insurance, loans, investment, debt manag ement, estate \\nplanning etc. There are five keys that can help you get control \\nof your finances. It gives you a clear plan that you are \\nfollowing.  \\nSet your financial  goals  \\nThe first thing you should do is to write specific goals \\nabout what you want to do wi th your life and your money. \\nFinances can affect many different areas of your life. Your goal \\nto travel the world affects how you will plan your finances. \\nYour goal to retire early is dependent on how well you handle \\nyour finances now. Home ownership, star ting a family, moving \\nor changing careers will all be affected b y how you manage \\nyour finances.  \\nOnce you have written down your goals you will need \\nto prioritize them.  This makes sure you are paying attention to \\nthe ones that are most important to you. You  can also list them  \\n 30 in the order you want to achieve them, but for a long -term goal \\nyou should be working towards it while working on your other \\ngoals.  \\nStart by setting long -term goals like getting out of debt, buying \\na home, or retiring early. These goals  can help you focus your \\nshorter term goals.  \\nPrioritize your goals  to help you create your  plan \\n(which is the next step). Set short -term goals, like following a \\nbudget, decreasing your spending, or stop using your credit \\ncards.  \\nCreate a p lan \\nA plan will he lp you reach your goals. The plan should \\nhave multiple steps. The first part of your plan should be to get \\ncontrol of your budget. Your budget is key to success. It is the \\ntool that will give you the most control of your financial future. \\nYour budget can h elp you reach the rest of your plan.  \\nStick to your b udget  \\nYour budget is one of the biggest tools that will help you \\nsucceed financially. It allows you to create a spending plan so \\nyou can focus your money in a way that will help you to reach \\nyour goals. A  budget lets you decide how to spend your money. \\nWithout the plan, you may spend your money on things that are  \\n 31 not important to you. If you are married you and your spouse \\nneed to work together on the budget. This will help you to \\nachieve your goals togeth er. \\nGet out of debt  \\nDebt is a huge obstacle to reaching your financial goals. Set up \\na debt elimination plan that will snowball your payments. \\nWhile making minimum payments, you focus extra money on \\none debt at a time and then move all the money you were \\npaying on the first debt to the next debt. Once you are out of \\ndebt, you need to make a commitment to stay out of debt. Stop \\ncarrying your credit cards around with you, and save up an \\nemergency fund to cover unexpected expenses so you do not \\nneed to turn to  a credit card to cover them.  \\nAsk for financial advices  \\nOnce you are ready to grow your wealth and begin \\ninvesting you should sp eak to financial consultants to help you \\nmake your investment decisions. A good consultant will share \\nthe risks involved in each  investment and help you work \\ntowards your goals as quickly as possible. A financial \\nconsultant can also help you with your budget. It should be \\nnoted that investing is a long -term strategy to building wealth. \\nCheck out these personal finance tips too.   \\n 32 The following sections of this manual address these issues \\nin more detail.  \\n \\nCheck your understanding :  \\n1) Why it is important to organize your personal finances \\nand make personal financial planning?  \\n2) Name the main principles of the financial management?  \\n3) Please co mpare your and your parents ’ financial needs \\nand discuss main differences?  \\nPractical assignment  \\n1) Please write down your financial g oals! \\n2) Write t he financial plan details how to accomplish the \\ngoals.  \\n \\nSources of information   \\n1.

INCOME INCREASE  \\nDifferent ways to increase income, self -employment, \\nprinciples of starting business, ed ucation and qualification \\nimprovement; volunteering – as an option to get experience, \\nsocial networks for trading, social entrepreneurs, training for \\nentrepreneurs . \\n \\nAims of topic :  \\n1) To expand the knowledge about the different sources of \\nincome;  \\n2) To be able to explain the different ways to increase \\nincome;  \\n3) To be able to prepare personal  income plan.  \\n \\nTHEORETICAL MATERIAL  \\n \\nThere are different options how to survive with very \\nlow incomes :  \\n\\uf0b7 reduce expenses where possible,  \\n\\uf0b7 understand the difference between savi ng and \\nparsimony,  \\n\\uf0b7 as much as possible to do the same,  \\n\\uf0b7 find free opportunities to have fun,   \\n 35 \\uf0b7 look for ways of additional income, etc.  \\nWays to increase your i ncome \\nCutting down on e xpenses  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce your rent  \\n\\uf0b7 Bike or walk to work, rather than drive  \\n\\uf0b7 Avoid eati ng out  \\n\\uf0b7 Do free leisure activities  \\n\\uf0b7 Get into a do -it-yourself lifestyle , etc.  \\nGenerating extra i ncome  \\n\\uf0b7 Talk to your employer about a raise  \\n\\uf0b7 Do freelance work or part time work  \\n\\uf0b7 Start a side business  \\nInvesting your m oney  \\n\\uf0b7 Create sources of passive income  \\n\\uf0b7 Purchase  stocks and bonds  \\n\\uf0b7 Consider  investing in penny stocks.  \\nSelf-employme nt \\nSelf-employed person  - someone who is self -employed \\nis the owner of a business, an individual who earns a living by \\nworking for himself  / herself and not as an employee of  \\n 36 someone else, and doesn\\'t work for an employer for wages or \\nsalary.   Self-employed person  is also someone who \"owns an \\nunincorporated business.\" You are self -employed if you have \\none of the following types of businesses:  \\n\\uf0b7 sole proprietorship  \\n\\uf0b7 partnership  \\n\\uf0b7 limited liability  company.  \\nA self -employed person must pay self -employment taxes \\n(social security and income), while an employee of a company \\nmust pay half of these taxes and the employer pays the other \\nhalf. \\nIn order to register for self-employment , you must apply to \\nyour local municip ality (where you are registered or d eclared \\nyour place of residence) . You must submit an application for \\nthe specific activity in which you want to operate. Depending \\non the type of activity, you must also submit an appropriate \\neducation o r qualification document (for example, translators, \\ncraftsmen, etc.). Then the special commission decides whether \\nto allow the relevant activity to be carried out. Taxes agency \\nwill issue an individual work registration certificate.   \\n 37 Principles of starting business  \\nThe other way to increase your income is to start your \\nown business. Information how to start business and \\nregister company in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania available \\nat: http://www.baltic -legal.com/latvia -company -types -of-\\nlegal -entities -eng.htm .  \\nAt first , you have to do a business plan. As a result of \\ncompleting the plan you will be much better prepared and \\nknow whether or not your business idea is feasible .  \\nSecondly , think about:  \\n1) How is your business unique, and why will your goods \\nor services appeal to customers?  \\n2) What are the primary differences between your \\ncompany and your competitors?  \\n3) What are the driving factors to choose your business \\nover another?  \\n4) In other words, what is the underlying reason a \\ncustomer would do business with your company?  \\nDefine your business and vision  \\nDefining your vision is important. It will become the driving \\nforce of your business. Here are questions that will help you \\nclarify your vision:  \\n▪ Who is the customer?   \\n 38 ▪ What business are you in?  \\n▪ What do you sell (product/service)?  \\n▪ What is your plan for growth?  \\n▪ What is your primary competitive advantage?  \\nWrite down your goals  \\nCreate a list of goals with a brief description of action ite ms. If \\nyour business is a start up, you will want to put more effort into \\nyour short -term goals. Often a new business concept must go \\nthrough a period of research and development before the \\noutcome can be accurately predicted for longer time frames.  \\nCreate  two sets of goals:  \\n1 Short term: range from six to 12 months.  \\n2 Long term: can be two to five years.  \\nExplain, as specifically as possible, what you want to achieve. \\nStart with your personal goals. Then list your business goals. \\nAnswer these questions:  \\n• As the owner of this business, what do you want to \\nachieve?  \\n• How large or small do you want this business to be?  \\n• Do you want to include family in your business?  \\n• Staff: do you desire to provide employment, or perhaps, \\nyou have a strong opinion on not wanting to man age \\npeople.   \\n 39 • Is there some cause that you want the business to \\naddress?  \\n• Describe the quality, quantity and/or service and \\ncustomer satisfaction levels.  \\n• How would you describe your primary competitive \\nadvantage?  \\n• How do you see the business making a differenc e in the \\nlives of your customers?  \\nUnderstand your customer  \\nIt is not realistic to expect you can meet the needs of everyone, \\nno business can. Choose your target market carefully. Overlook \\nthis area, and I guarantee you will be disappointed with the \\nperform ance of your business. Get this right and you will be \\nmore than pleased with the results.  \\n• Needs: what unmet needs do your prospective \\ncustomers have? How does your business meet those \\nneeds? It is usually something the customer does not \\nhave or a need that  is not currently being met. Identify \\nthose unmet needs.  \\n• Wants: think of this as your customer’s desire or wish. \\nIt can also be a deficiency.   \\n 40 • Problems: remember people buy things to solve a \\nspecific problem. What problems does your product or \\nservice solve ? \\n• Perceptions: what are the negative and positive \\nperceptions that customers have about you, your \\nprofession and its products or services? Identify both \\nthe negative and positive consequences. You will be \\nable to use what you learn when you start marketing  \\nand promoting your business.  \\nLearn from your competition  \\nYou can learn a lot about your business and customers by \\nlooking at how your competitors do business. Here are some \\nquestions to help you learn from your competition and focus on \\nyour customer:  \\n• What  do you know about your target market?  \\n• What competitors do you have?  \\n• How are competitors approaching the market?  \\n• What are the competitor’s weaknesses and strengths?  \\n• How can you improve upon the competition’s \\napproach?  \\n• What are the lifestyles, demographics and \\npsychographics of your ideal customer?   \\n 41 Financial matters  \\nHow will you make money? What is your break -even \\npoint? How much profit potential does your business have? \\nTake the time to invest in preparing financial projections.  \\nThese projections should tak e into account the \\ncollection period for your accounts receivables (outstanding \\ncustomer accounts) as well as the payment terms for your \\nsuppliers. For example, you may pay your bills in 30 days, but \\nhave to wait 45 -60 days to get paid from your customers.  \\nA cash flow projection will show you how much \\nworking capital you will need during those “gaps” in your cash \\nposition.  \\nI recommend thinking about these six key areas:  \\n1 Start -up Investment  \\n2 Assumptions  \\n3 Running Monthly Overhead  \\n4 Streamlined Sales Forecast  \\n5 Cumu lative Cash  \\n6 Break -even  \\nIdentify your marketing strategy  \\nThere are four steps to creating a marketing strategy for your \\nbusiness:   \\n 42 1 Identify all target m arkets:  define who is your ideal \\ncustomer or target market. Most companies experience \\n80% of their  busines s from 20% of their customers. It \\nmakes sense then to direct your time and energy toward \\nthose customers who are most important.  \\n2 Qualify the best target m arkets:  the purpose of this \\nstep is to further qualify and determine which customer \\nprofile meets the best odds of success. The strategy is to \\nposition your business at the same level as the majority \\nof the buyers you are targeting. It is critical to figure out \\nwho your best customers are and how to best position \\nyour company in the marketplace.  \\n3 Identify t ools, strategies and m ethods:  a market you \\ncannot access is a market you cannot serve. Marketing \\nis the process of finding, communicating and educating \\nyour primary market about your products and services. \\nChoose a combination of tools and strategies, that  when \\ncombined, increase your odds of success.  \\n4 Test marketing strategy and t ools:  the assumptions \\nwe do not verify are typically the ones that have the \\npotential to create business problems. Take the time to \\ntest all business assumptions, especially when y ou are \\nmaking major expenditures.   \\n 43 Volunteering – as an option to get experience  \\n\\uf0b7 Volunteering is a win -win situation. By helping others, \\nyou have the opportunity to boost not only your career \\nbut also your own well -being . Here’s how v olunteering \\ncan help yo u: \\n\\uf0b7 You expand your personal and professional \\nnetworks.  People already working in your target field \\nare great sources of information about job openings, \\naffinity organizations, and people you should meet. And \\nif you have a good experience volunteering, your  \\nsupervisor might serve as a reference when you’re \\napplying to jobs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Volunteering will help you develop new job skills as \\nwell as apply current skills in new ways . For instance,  \\na mid -career professional who has worked in concert \\npromotions could use her marketing skills to help an \\norganization with their fundraising or other mission -\\nbased events. A college student accustomed to doing \\nresearch for school assignments could volunteer to \\nresearch an issue or demographic for a non -profit. For \\ninspiration about  what skills you might share and an \\noverview of some organizations’ current needs, peruse \\nour information about volunteering in your country or  \\n 44 abroad, and search volunteer opportunities around the \\nworld.  \\n\\uf0b7 Volunteering allows you to try on different \\norganiz ations, roles, issues , etc., without job -hopping. \\nOf course, volunteering isn’t the same as being on staff, \\nbut it can expose you to the work of an organization in a \\ndeeper way than becoming a member, following it on \\nTwitter, or even conducting an informat ional interview \\nwith an employee.  \\n\\uf0b7 Volunteering builds your confidence . Volunteering \\ncan help you feel active, useful and productive.  \\n\\uf0b7 Volunteering helps you get to know yourself . \\nKnowing your skills, accomplishments, interests and \\nvalues is the foundation o f career success. Volunteer \\nexperience can be a good way to learn more about \\nyourself and your potential to grow and develop. It also \\ngives you a chance to find out how other people view \\nyou and your strengths.  \\nSocial entreprene urship   \\nSocial entrepreneurs hip is    \\n 45 • About applying practical, innovative and sustainable \\napproaches to benefit society in general, with an \\nemphasis on those who are marginalized and poor.  \\n• A term that captures a unique approach to economic \\nand social problems, an approach that cuts ac ross \\nsectors and disciplines grounded in certain values and \\nprocesses that are common to each social entrepreneur, \\nindependent of whether his/ her area of focus has been \\neducation, health, welfare reform, human rights, \\nworkers\\' rights, environment, economi c development, \\nagriculture, etc., or whether the organizations they set \\nup are non -profit or for -profit entities.  \\n• It is this approach that sets the social entrepreneur apart \\nfrom the rest of the crowd of well -meaning people and \\norganizations who dedicate t heir lives to social \\nimprovement.  \\nSocial entrepreneurs drive social innovation and \\ntransformation in various fields including education, health, \\nenvironment and enterprise development. They pursue poverty \\nalleviation goals with entrepreneurial zeal, busine ss methods \\nand the courage to innovate and overcome traditional practices.  \\nA social entrepreneur, similar to a business \\nentrepreneur, builds strong and sustainable organizations,  \\n 46 which are either set up as not -for-profits or companies.  A social \\nentrepreneu r is a leader or pragmatic visionary who:  \\n▪ Achieves large scale, systemic and sustainable social \\nchange through a new invention, a different approach, a \\nmore rigorous application of known technologies or \\nstrategies, or a combination of these.  \\n▪ Focuses first and foremost on the social and/or \\necological value creation and tries to optimize the \\nfinancial value creation.  \\n▪ Innovates by finding a new product, a new service, or a \\nnew approach to a social problem.   \\n▪ Continuously refines and adapts approach in response \\nto feedback.   \\n▪ Combines the characteristics represented by Richard \\nBranson and Mother Teresa , etc. \\nThe following criteria characterizing  leading social \\nentrepreneurs: Innovation, Sustainability, Reach and social \\nimpact.   \\nSocial entrepreneurs  share some com e common traits \\nincluding:  \\n\\uf0b7 An unwavering belief in the innate capacity of all \\npeople to contribute meaningfully to economic and \\nsocial development.   \\n 47 \\uf0b7 A driving passion to make that happen.   \\n\\uf0b7 A practical but innovative stance to a social problem, \\noften using m arket principles and forces, coupled with \\ndogged determination, that allows them to break away \\nfrom constraints imposed by ideology or field of \\ndiscipline, and pushes them to take risks that others \\nwouldn\\'t dare.   \\n\\uf0b7 A zeal to measure and monitor their impact . \\nEntrepreneurs have high standards, particularly in \\nrelation to their own organization’s efforts and in \\nresponse to the communities with which they engage. \\nData, both quantitative and qualitative, are their key \\ntools, guiding continuous feedback and impro vement.   \\n• A healthy impatience. Social Entrepreneurs cannot sit \\nback and wait for change to happen – they are the \\nchange drivers.  \\nTraining for entrepreneurs  \\nIn all countries involved in the project, there are various \\neducational activities for young peo ple to start their own \\nbusiness, e.g.: http://www.connectlatvia.lv/activities/training/ . \\nThere are also various support measures in all countries, such \\nas facilitated business start -ups, finance,  etc.  \\n 48 Practical assignment (discussion with the adviser)   \\n1) Discuss the ways to increase your income.  \\n2) Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each option.  \\n3) Identify the financial resources, qualifications or legal \\nrequirements for each opportunity.  \\n \\nPractica l tasks  \\n1) Check out self -employment and business registration \\noptions at your place of residence.  \\n2) Find out opportunities of volunteering at place of your \\nresidence. Choose an opportunity that strikes your \\ninterest.  \\n3) Identify your business interests! What acti vities does it \\ninvolve! Which business form would be most suitable \\nfor? Describe what could be your business start -up \\nprocess!  \\n4) If you are employed, evaluate options for the promotion \\nand salary? Find out if there\\'s any chance of a n \\nadditional work hours or  part time work.   \\n 49  \\nSources of information   \\n1) How to survive with very low incomes?  \\nhttps://compeuro.lv/ka -izdzivot -ar-loti-maziem -ienakumiem/  \\n2)  How to Increase Your Income:  \\n http://www.wikihow.com/Increase -Your -Income   \\n3) Bussiness startup strategy:   \\nhttp://articles.bplans.com/business -start-up-strategy/   \\n4) What is a Social Entrepreneur ship:  \\nhttp://www.schwabfound.org/content/what -social -entrepreneur   \\n5) How to start business in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia: \\nhttp://www.baltic -legal.com/latvia -company -types -of-\\nlegal -entities -eng.htm  \\n6) Training for entrepreneurs:  \\nhttp://www.connectlatvia.lv/a ctivities/training/ . \\n \\n   \\n 50 Module III. LIVING ACCORDI NG TO THE \\nINCOME   \\nIncome and expenses planning  \\n \\nAims of topic : \\n1. To learn about different types of personal expenditure.  \\n2. To be able to prepare  an expenses plan.  \\n3. To understand cost reduction techniques.  \\n \\nTHEO RETICAL MATERIAL  \\nClassification of expenses  \\nFor the implementation of short -term and long -term goals \\nit is necessary to know your financial capabilities. It can be set \\nin planning cash flows. Cash flow  is what we get and what we \\nspend, or, in other words, income and expenses. Cash flow \\nplanning  - cost of planning and the allocation of income (that \\nof the existing and planned expenditure does not exceed the \\ncurrent and future income).  \\nOur needs and desires can be unlimited. If we would \\nwant to implement all of them, very quickly our expenditure \\nwould exceed income. This would result in a lack of money, \\nmeaning that we would have to borrow or spend our savings.  \\n 51 However, savings are limited, and some people do not have \\nthem at all.  \\nIncome is usually generated o nce or twice a month, but it \\nis spent daily . For example, some parents  give pocket money to \\ntheir child once a week or once a month, but their child has to \\npay for school lunch each day. Therefore , it is important to \\ndivide or allocate income so that the c hild can buy what is \\nnecessary and would not need to borrow. People who work and \\nreceive a salary once or twice a month, have to allocate the \\nmoney so that all family members can eat and be clothed for a \\nwhole month as well as have money to pay for housing  \\nmaintenance and so on.  \\nUsually income is fixed and the expenses are not. For \\nexample, some parents will give their child the same amount of \\nmoney each week, but the costs for lunch in the school canteen \\nvary every day, depending on what your child eats.  Housing \\nmaintenance costs and the cost of food every month may vary so \\nit is important to handle the costs in a way that they do not \\nexceed the income, to spend less than is received. This becomes \\neven more complicated i f different amounts of income are  \\nreceived every time.  In this case, it is difficult to plan how much \\nmoney will remain for personal expenses. You always need to pay \\nfor the most important things first (food, housing maintenance and  \\n 52 so on.), and only if you have money remaining, it can be spe nt on \\nnot as necessary items or services.  You have to prepare a cash \\nflow budget in order to see whether costs exceed income, or \\nthere\\'s free money.  \\nWe do not have any more income without salary, so most \\npeople know their incomes well and don\\'t even count it. The \\nsituation with expenses are a bit different. There are very \\ndifferent types of expenses.  \\nTherefore, more attention should be given for expenses \\nmanagement. there are more difficult  to control income than to \\ncontrol expenses. Because the size of in come depend s for \\ncertain factors: do we have job or no, w hat is the amount of \\nsalary , is there a lot of work and etc. Expenses are managed by \\nourselves so it is important to know how to manage it.  \\nThe expenses can be grouped in various ways. \\nClassification  of expenses in various aspects are  useful because \\nthey provide a lot more information and opportunities to start \\nmanaging them.  \\nExpenses by function  \\nExpenses by function  can be grouped as they are \\ndistributed by the (Statistics of Lithuania) Classificatio n of \\nIndividual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) developed by  \\n 53 the European Cooperation and Development, cooperation with \\nEurostat:  \\n\\uf0b7 Food and non -alcoholic beverages;  \\n\\uf0b7 Alcoholic beverages, tobacco;  \\n\\uf0b7 Clothing and footwear (also cleaning, repair and hire of \\ncloth ing);  \\n\\uf0b7 Housing maintenance costs (housing, water, electricity, \\ngas and other fuels);  \\n\\uf0b7 Furnishings, household equipment and routine household \\nmaintenance (furniture and furnishings; carpets and other \\nfloor coverings; household textiles, household \\nappliances; glassware, tableware and household utensils; \\ntools and equipment for house and garden; goods and \\nservices for routine household maintenance);  \\n\\uf0b7 Health (medical products, appliances and equipment; \\noutpatient services; hospital services);  \\n\\uf0b7 Transport (purchase o f vehicles; operation of personal \\ntransport equipment; transport services);  \\n\\uf0b7 Communication  (postal services; telephone and telefax \\nequipment and telefax services);  \\n\\uf0b7 Recreation and culture (Audio -visual, photographic and \\ninformation processing equipment; othe r major durables \\nfor recreation and culture; other recreational items and  \\n 54 equipment, gardens and pets; recreational and cultural \\nservices; newspapers, books and stationery; package \\nholidays);  \\n\\uf0b7 Education (pre -primary and primary education; \\nsecondary educatio n; post -secondary non -tertiary \\neducation; education not definable by level);  \\n\\uf0b7 Restaurants and hotels (catering services and \\naccommodation services);  \\n\\uf0b7 Miscellaneous goods and services (personal care; \\npersonal effects n.e.c.; social protection; insurance; \\nfinancial services n.e.c.);  \\n\\uf0b7 Individual consumption expenditure of non -profit \\ninstitutions serving households;  \\n\\uf0b7 Individual consumption expenditure of general \\ngovernment.  \\nThe above grouping of expenses are useful as specified \\nactivities require the greatest cost.  In addition, grouped expenses \\ncan compare how a person lives to a statistical citizen.  \\nExpenses by the frequency  \\nIt is useful to group expenses by the frequency : daily, \\nmonthly, seasonal, annual, one -time expenses. Classification of  \\n 55 expenses by frequency is helpful when they are planning for a \\nlonger period of time.  \\nExpenses according to the standard of living  \\nGrouping expenses according to the standard of living  – \\nminimum, normal, luxurious –  allows to accurately count the \\ncost of a personal life or fami ly life, to see what the minimum \\namount of money would be to survive, what it would cost to \\nlive normally and how much a luxurious life would cost . \\nExpenses according to the needs  \\nEveryone can set and estimate their needs, which is \\ndependent on the desired  standard of living. It is therefore \\nrecommended to group expenses according to the needs  (Figure \\n3.1). Such grouping is useful to estimate your goal because the \\nhigher the needs the higher the cost.  \\n \\n \\n 56 Figure 3.1. Expenses classification according to the n eeds \\nExpenses according to the degree of regularity  \\nExpenses  are classified according to the degree of \\nregularity  (Table 3.1):  \\n\\uf0b7 fixed expenses (food, utilities);  \\n\\uf0b7 regular expenses (clothing, footwear, cosmetics);  \\n\\uf0b7 one-time expenses (treatment, durables).  \\nTable 3.1. Example of annual income and expenses plan  \\nMonth  \\nJanuary  \\nFebruary  \\nMarch  \\nApril  \\nMay \\nJune \\nJuly \\nAugust  \\nSeptember  \\nOctober  \\nNovember  \\nDecember  \\nFixed \\nexpenses              \\nRegular \\nexpenses              \\nOne-time \\nexpenses              \\nIncome              \\n \\nSome fixed costs are the same, such as: various \\npayments (cable TV, internet, sports clubs); housing rental and \\nmaintenance costs (regular payment); transport costs (monthly  \\n 57 tickets); loan fees; savings (the money you want to save should \\nbe attributed to the expenses). Other fixed costs are changing \\nevery month, maintenance costs (fees for water, electricity, \\nheating, gas); food expenses; charges for mobile phone; fuel \\ncosts; various personal expenses (products of personal hygiene, \\nhairdressing services, etc.) ; expenses for entertainment.  \\nExpenses according to the degree of necessity  \\nExpenses are classified  according to the degree of \\nnecessity : \\n\\uf0b7 necessary expenses (for food, clothing, treatment);  \\n\\uf0b7 optional expenses (education, insurance, stocks and \\nbonds).  \\nExpens es according to the purpose of use  \\n Expenses are classified  according to the purpose of use : \\n\\uf0b7 consumer expenses (to pay for purchase of goods and \\nservices);  \\n\\uf0b7 taxes and mandatory and voluntary payments;  \\n\\uf0b7 savings deposits, stocks and bonds;  \\n\\uf0b7 purchase of foreign currency;  \\n\\uf0b7 increase of own money.  \\nDifferent expenses are managed by different tools. Easy \\nmanageable expenses depend on human purpose and choice.   \\n 58 Intracta ble - the expenses of which can not be avoided (costs for \\nheating, electricity, water, determined by pre vious decisions of \\ncosts - debt).  \\nThe main and most common expenses: commitments \\n(loans), food and transport. Other expenditure  includes \\nclothing, shoes, children\\'s expenses, entertainment, travel, \\nmoney for saving. Not all expenses have the same costs. C osts \\nfor children (pocket money) are relevant only to people that \\nhave children, therefore others do not have such costs.  \\nExpense budget  \\nYou can start managing the expenses when you know \\nwhat type of expenditure incurred. You can do this through \\nspending p lans called expenses budgets  (Table 3.2). A plan \\nlike this will help you to always know how many you can \\nafford and you can avoid unnecessary costs therefore it is \\npossible to reach the financial goals.  \\nWhen you are planning expenses, you should review \\ncurrent costs, analys e them and make expenses  plan for th e \\nfuture according to the income. Y ou could use the information \\nalready available - records of bank card statements, old receipts \\nand so on.   \\n 59 There are also costs that occur only occasionally, and the \\namounts can be more different. This could be the costs of new \\nhousehold appliances, new clothes, entertainment. These may \\nbe pleasant for everyone, but they are not necessary objects.  \\nTable 3.2. Example of monthly expenses plan  \\nX month income EUR  1 000  \\nExpenses E UR Plan 01 02 03 .... \\nFood and non -alcoholic \\nbeverages  250     \\nHousing maintenance  60     \\nTransport  60     \\nHealth care  5     \\nClothing and footwear  0     \\nCommunication   30     \\nPersonal hygiene products  20     \\nPocket money fo r children  10     \\nRecreation and culture  20     \\nEducation  0     \\nRestaurants and cafe  60     \\nHousing maintenance  0     \\nGifts  20     \\nOther  30      \\n 60 Insta lment of loans  230     \\nLife insurance and pension  60     \\nSavings  60     \\nTotal  915     \\n  \\nKeeping the expenses pla n is recommended for a long  \\nperiod of time - a few months, half a year or a year, then you \\ncan predict which of the fixed costs rise and when any one -time \\ncosts might occur. When you have more time to prepare, and \\nhave more opportunities to take care of th e necessary money - \\nsave, borrow, to change today plans and so on.  \\nTo determine if the cost plan is right, it can be compared \\nto the planned expenses and revenues. If it\\'s a longer period \\n(six months or a year) the planned costs are higher than \\nplanned rev enues and savings are available , it is worth looking \\nthrough the plan and perhaps immediately refuse some of the \\nwish.  Before deciding to borrow the missing money it should \\nbe planned in advance, as from what money and when (how \\nlong) to return debt.  \\nIf you have longer -term plan, you will need to create a \\nmonthly spending plan. Monthly spending plan – the part of a \\nyear expenses plan. We already know how much monthly \\nincome we should get as we plan to spend as much as we can  \\n 61 so we should save. Each time we  spend money  in the relevant \\nexpenditure line we will need to write down how much spent \\nand how much money was left in the month.  \\nBefore you begin to live according to the plan, there \\nshould be at least half of the monthly income margin. This may \\nbe requir ed if inexperience caused it to be planned unwell.   \\nExpenditure management includes the concept of \\noptimization. After analysis of each item of expenditure you \\ncan ask yourself, how many one or the oth er costs are needed \\nfor, or may be you can the same need  satisfy cheaper.  \\nHow to control the costs  \\nThe costs should be controlled in 3 ways:  \\n1) Identification of optimal collection types of \\nexpenditure. That is to review all existing costs and to \\ndecide if they are related to the sati sfaction of the \\nnecessary nee ds; \\n2) Checking the amount of consumer goods or services. \\nDo you really need so much? If consumption can be \\nreduced, it is necessary to provide the ways to do so \\n(water and energy savings by turning off the lights as \\nyou exit, turn off the tap water when fini shed, buy more \\neconomical household appliances);   \\n 62 3) Revising the prices of consumer goods and services. \\nMaybe you can buy the same amounts of goods at a \\nlower price?  \\nCosts optimization and saving needs help us to ensure the \\nquality of your life, and that\\'s wh at we want. We just need to \\nlearn to save and to keep doing it. Saving should start with the \\nlittle things . Low -cost and minimum wages – are unfavorable \\nfor saving. The expenses consist of basic costs - housing, food \\nand transport. Therefore , it is very di fficult to live with low \\nincomes.  Having low-income and being able to meeting basic \\nneeds - it\\'s already a skill.  But, in this case, even w ith low -\\nincome, it\\'s necessary for everyone to know their budget and \\ncosts.  \\nHow to reduce your regular expenses  \\n\\uf0b7 Do no t carry the money that you want to save in a wallet. \\nThe money should be kept in a safer place, maybe someone \\ncould keep it, or maybe the money should be placed in a bank \\ndeposit account or piggy bank.  \\n\\uf0b7 If you have a weakness for spending more money than \\nneeded in store, you have to limit the number of visits you take \\nto the store or when you do not know exactly what you will \\nbuy, go to the store without cash. You can limit the time you \\nspend in the store.    \\n 63 \\uf0b7 Shop once a week with a minimum list of products. \\nDon’t go to the store hungry. The best way to save on food - to \\nform a full week list of products which will you need for \\ndishes.  \\n\\uf0b7 Look at what products you still have at home. Shopping \\nshould start from a kitchen inspection so that you won\\'t buy too \\nmuch or  buy unnecessary products in the store.  \\n\\uf0b7 It is cheaper to buy more units at once of the longer \\nexisting goods. You can wait for a sale.  \\n\\uf0b7 Only buy when you need it, rather than because of a \\n\"discount\" as it is not very good to buy more than what is \\nnecessary.  \\n\\uf0b7 Buying online can be cheaper, because you can find and \\ncompare prices, as much as one or the other product costs to \\ndifferent seller. Finally , you can go to the store and buy it after \\nchoosing it online.  \\n\\uf0b7 If you have dinner in a restaurant you will spend l ess if \\nyou do not buy any drinks.  \\n\\uf0b7 You can save in housing maintenance if you reduce the \\nflow of water and will use economical light bulbs, and will \\nrefuse some services (telephone, Internet, cable TV) or replace \\nthem with cheaper ones.   \\n 64 \\uf0b7 When you make the ye ar budget it is important to know \\nnot only the expenses but also to existing contracts. You can \\ncheck the contract to find out if you have a good Internet, \\ntelephone and television use conditions . There are many \\npromotions, discounts and other suitable pro posals . Just go to \\nyour service provider, and they will adopt the best conditions, \\nsuitable for your needs . \\n\\uf0b7 To save transport costs you can organize driving with \\nseveral people in one vehicle rather than one .  \\n\\uf0b7 If you do not have time to make a plan, and th en control \\ncosts, you could create a periodic transfer agreement with a \\nbank , then from the account to which salary is transferred \\nimmediately to the date of receipt of income savings deposit \\naccount would be tr ansferred to the desired amount s of savings.   \\nCheck your understanding   \\n1. Why is it necessary to manage cash flow and costs?  \\n2. What are the reasons for budget preparation or not \\npreparation?  \\n3. What expenses are fixed?  \\n4. What expenses are regular?  \\n5.

MANAGING THE MONEY  \\nLiving now – implementing  short term goals in daily life \\n- real incomes, sample of budget model, income and expenses \\nplanning, planning of financial reserve (extra money)  \\nTheoretical material  \\nDaily life arrangement is in many ways connected to \\nmoney. We exchange money for what we need for a daily \\nsurvival, i.e. we make expenditures.  \\nIn everyday  life, every person needs to have a thorough \\nunderstanding of what money is and how important it is. First \\nand foremost, one needs to have an overview of his/her income \\nand expenditure. Everybody has to know where their incomes \\ncome from (what are their so urces of income) and how big they \\nare. It is equally important for each person to know what and \\nhow big their expenses are. It is wise to group one’s expenses. \\nComparing our incomes and expenses we are able to draw \\nconclusions about our financial behaviour . \\nExample:  \\nA person receives 400 euros of monthly salary (after tax) to his \\nbank account. Can this person afford a smart phone that costs \\n420 euros?   \\n 75 Before you answer, think if/how it is possible to get the \\nmissing 20 euros; if the person really has these 20 euros (for \\ninstance, he has saved it from his previous month’s salary), \\nwould it be wise to purchase this phone or not?  \\nWhy is it not reasonable for this person to buy this \\nphone? (He does not have enough money for living – food, \\naccommodation, transpor t, and other basic needs).  \\nTo be able to manage one’s everyday life in terms of \\nmoney, one needs to learn how to estimate one’s expenditure \\nand how to make a budget. Write down all your costs; don’t \\nforget accommodation costs, food, entertainment, clothes and \\nother items. It is important that a young person could control \\nhis/her impulses to waste money on things that s/he cannot \\nafford and/or does not need.  \\nTo avoid unpleasant financial surprises, a young person \\nand his/her adviser should analyse together w hat s/he spends \\nmoney on and how big are his/her regular daily and monthly \\nexpenditures, and how much s/he spends on single -purchase \\nitems. It is important to discuss if/what kind of expenses can be \\ncovered with the support of the parents, relatives, or so cial \\nwelfare benefits. It is important to stress that a person with \\nfinancial literacy problems needs to discuss and analyse all  \\n 76 these ideas with his/her adviser. If s/he intends to ask for \\nfinancial support from his/her family, local government, etc., it \\nhas to be well planned and there has to be a clear understanding \\nand agreement between the parties about the procedure and \\nremuneration of the money to the person who has covered the \\nexpenses.  \\nExample:  \\nPlease explain a situation and analyse the possible \\noutcomes if you plan to buy something and think (without \\ndiscussing with the family) that your parents will pay for it. In \\nreality it turns out that your parents cannot or do not agree to \\ndo it.  \\nTo make expenditures, we need money  \\n\\uf0d8 We have to spend money on f ood, clothing, housing, \\ncommunication facilities, transport etc.  \\n \\nPractical assignment : \\nDiscuss with the young person  \\n\\uf0b7 what he spends money on daily/every month;  \\n\\uf0b7 which are his/her recurrent/regular and one -time \\nexpenses;   \\n 77 \\uf0b7 what is his/her main item of everyda y expenditure;  \\n\\uf0b7 which expenses can be reduced or cancelled, and which \\nexpenses are inevitable and cannot be changed;  \\n\\uf0b7 what is impulse purchase (wasting of money) and what \\ncould be the consequences of making impulse \\npurchases?  \\nArranging one’s daily life  \\n\\uf0d8 Possi bilities for getting money, i.e. actual income – \\nsalary, scholarship, government benefit etc.  \\n\\uf0d8 Possibilities for spending money –   \\nPractical assignmen t (discussion with the adviser)  \\n1) Explain/discuss different ways of obtaining/earning \\nmoney with a focus on the importance of paid \\nemployment in formation of income.  \\n2) Do the person’s qualifications, skills and experience \\nenable him/her to increase his/her income?  \\n3) Explain/discuss the opportunities and schemes for \\napplying for scholarships and grants.  \\n4) Explain/discu ss the system and terms of the government \\nsupport schemes .  \\n 78 Financial planning and setting of goals  \\nPlanning:  \\n\\uf0fc Analyse your wishes and needs  \\n\\uf0fc Assess your possibilities  \\n\\uf0fc Choose, compare and decide  \\nPractical assignment:  \\nDiscuss together with the adviser why sett ing financial \\ngoals is important, so that the person advised could understand \\nand admit the significance of goal setting and planning.  \\nWhen we discuss planning, we should talk about \\neveryday activities and events: planning a weekend, a birthday \\nparty, meet ing up/gathering with one’s friends, etc. Everyday \\nfinancial planning also includes finding out/comparing the \\nprices of items (a phone, a bike, a computer, etc.) when one \\nplans/needs to purchase something rather expensive.  \\nPractical assignment (discussion with the adviser):  \\nWas the above example about short -term, medium term \\nor long -term planning?  \\nApproximately how long a period in time could the \\nprocess of planning cover in case of long -term planning?   \\n 79 Long -term planning  \\nObviously, speaking of long -term pla nning, we mean a \\nperiod of time more than five years ahead.  \\nPractical assignment (discussion with the adviser):  \\n1) Is it possible/ realistic to make plans for 20 -30 years \\nahead?  \\n2) Explain/discuss the aspect/importance of money and the \\namount of money needed in the context of different life \\nevents.  \\nWe can, conclude that if a person is able to rationally \\nmanage and plan his/her finances, s/he is also able to cope \\nfinancially in all everyday situations as well as to be prepared \\nfor unexpected circumstances.  \\nIt is i mportant to plan and make preparations for the \\nevents that we know will take place, but also to be ready for \\nunexpected situations. In addition to positive and happy events, \\nlife can also bring sudden negative turns, which we have not \\nexpected to happen.  \\nExample:  \\n\\uf0d8 There is a problem with your computer. At the \\nworkshop it becomes clear that the repair is too  \\n 80 expensive as one could get a new computer at the same \\nprice. The estimated cost of the repair is 400 euros. \\nWhat are your options: have you saved money a nd are \\nable to pay for the repairs/to buy a new computer, or \\nshould you get a loan? Or should you change your IT \\nhabits and use the library or other public computer/ \\nInternet access facilities until you have been able to \\nsave up for a new computer?  \\nDiscuss ion with the adviser:  \\nWhat is more reasonable - to buy a new computer or to \\nhave the old one repaired?  \\nWill a new computer purchased with a loan be more \\nexpensive in the end?  \\n\\uf0d8 What are the actual financial options and needs if one \\ngets a notice of dismissal ? Is it possible to find a new \\njob and how long that could take? What kind of \\nmonetary compensation can a person get (redundancy \\npayment, unemployment benefit) during a limited \\nperiod of time in case of dismissal? Does s/he have any \\nsavings to pay for food , accommodation, loans, etc. \\nbetween two jobs?   \\n 81 \\uf0d8 If a person who has lost his/her job has a family, it is \\nimportant to consider such life events as the birth of a \\nchild, a child/children starting school, etc. that require \\nadditional expenses.  \\nShort -term goal s \\nShort -term goals → planning income and expenditures \\nof the near future  \\nExample of a short -term goal:  \\nYou plan to go on a holiday to Greece next year. For \\nthat you will need 900 euros, but you have no savings. It means \\nthat you will need to save a minimum o f 75 euros each months \\n((900/12 = 75).  \\nYou could also use a bank loan. The  yearly interest rate \\nfor a loan of 900 euros is 24% and you have to make equal \\nrepayments to the bank every month (this is called annuity). It \\nmeans that every month you have to pay  to the bank 85 euros \\nwhich includes the repayment of the principal amount of the \\nloan and the interest, the total amount per year is 1020 euros. \\nSo, for the bank loan of 900 euros you have paid additionally \\nabout 120 euros of interest. Normally the bank a lso charges  \\n 82 you for concluding the loan agreement, which adds even more \\nto the amount that you have to pay to the bank.  \\n \\nMedium -term goals  \\nMedium -term goals → wishes for purchases during the \\nnext couple of years  \\nExample of a medium -term goal:  \\nYou plan to purchase a car. You opt for a used car that \\ncosts about 5000 euros. If you can save 100 euros a month and \\nsupposing the cost of the vehicle category does not change, you \\nwill be able to buy the car in four years. If you purchase the car \\nwith a bank loan, t he interest rate being 20%, you will have to \\nmake monthly repayments of approximately 152 euros, with a \\ntotal amount of 7303 euros. The total amount of the interest \\npaid to the bank is 2303 euros plus the loan agreement charge. \\nYou have purchased the car q uickly but in the end you pay for \\nit nearly twice as much as its original price.  \\nLong -term goals  \\nLong -term goals  → wishes for purchases after more \\nthan five years   \\n 83 Example of a long -term goal:  \\nA person who is 30 years old wishes to get a monthly \\npension of 600 when he/she retires, which is the double of the \\ncurrently paid average retirement pension. Let us presume that \\nthe current state pension scheme does not change and the \\nretirement age is 65 years. If a person lives to the age of 80 or \\nover, s/he has to save at least 54,000 euros during 35 years (300 \\n€/month, or 3,600 € a year, 15 years x 3,600 € = 54,000 €). A \\nperson building up this amount of money during 35 years needs \\nto save for 128 a month, which is quite a big sum of money to \\nbe set aside.  \\nIt is al so important to keep oneself informed about other \\nways of saving money and enhancing one’s incomes offered by \\nalternative pension schemes.  \\nPlanning procedure  \\n1. Make a list of 12 items that need to be purchased during \\nthe next five years.  \\n2. Group the items in short, medium and long -term \\npurchases.  \\n3. Select the three most needed items from a short -term \\nperiod and identify their prices.   \\n 84 4. Select one medium -term and one long -term item and \\nidentify their prices.  \\n5. Where to get money to buy the items; estimate how \\nlong it  will take to save up the required sum to buy the \\nitems needed.  \\n \\nTo gain a financial independence  \\nProducing a personal budget and financial plan may \\nhelp gaining a financial independence:  \\nStep 1  is producing a personal financial plan → identifying \\ngoals  \\nStep 2  is producing a budget: comparing income and costs  \\nIt is reasonable to split expenditures into inevitable and \\noptional ones. Inevitable expenditures are those on \\nfood, housing, hygiene, in some cases on medicaments \\netc. \\nOptional expenditures are thos e on leisure time, \\ntravelling etc. To a certain extent, also expenditures on \\nhousehold, clothing and other durable goods are \\noptional. Optional expenditures may be reduced without  \\n 85 jeopardising one’s life, health and future, although the \\ncuts may not be ple asant.  \\nFor most people, salary is the main income source. In \\nsome cases, government benefits, earnings from \\ninvestments or entrepreneurship may be an income \\nsource. When planning one’s income, it is reasonable to \\nconsider that the income level may change o ver time, \\nand not always upwards.  \\nStep 3 is carrying out analysis  \\nIn case the income exceeds the running costs, one can \\nfind out how many of the financial goals can be reached \\nfrom the surplus. In case, there is no surplus or it is too \\nsmall, one should fi rst of all revise the costs. Only a few \\npeople keep their expenditures entirely rational. After a \\ncritical look on costs, take a look on the income – is it \\npossible to increase one’s income by additional work or \\nchange a current job for a higher paid one?  \\nPersonal budget:  \\nINCOME  - COSTS  \\nIncome exceeds costs → possibility for saving   \\n 86 Costs exceed income → all expenditures cannot be made (need \\nfor cutting costs or seeking for additional income)  \\nFor cutting costs, it is necessary to have a priority list, \\ni.e. list of costs that are inevitabl e and cutting of which is \\nproblematic (food, housing, transport).  \\nNeed for saving  arises from situations requiring \\nemergency (not planned) expenditures and they may sometimes \\noccur. Think of such possible situations.  \\nSavings  (the money saved) secure bearin g such costs \\nwithout getting into a crisis situation.  \\nAction in case of solvency problems:  \\n\\uf0d8 Analyse your financial situation – be honest and critical \\nin finding the reasons why you do not have enough \\nmoney to cover your costs; make sure if it is a short -\\nterm or a continuous problem;  \\n\\uf0d8 Draft a budget for yourself/your family – that will help \\nyou to get an overview of the actual situation and real \\nneeds and possibilities for adjustment of your incomes \\nand expenditure;  \\n\\uf0d8 Cooperate with your creditors or partners t o who you \\nare in debt;   \\n 87 \\uf0d8 You must not get a new loan to pay your outstanding \\nprevious loans;  \\n\\uf0d8 Try to repay as much as you can  - by doing that you \\ndemonstrate your willingness to pay your debts;  \\n\\uf0d8 You have to cut your expenditure;  \\n\\uf0d8 As you need more money to pay the debts, look for \\nadditional sources of income;  \\n\\uf0d8 Consider selling your immovable property, or try to \\nexchange your current home for a cheaper dwelling;  \\n\\uf0d8 Be sure to communicate with your creditors and read \\nthrough their emails/letters. You should not ignore  their \\nnegative messages but need to respond to them;  \\n\\uf0d8 Seek for the moral support of your family and friends \\nand familiarise yourself with the legal aspects of the \\nprocesses that have started – you need to know your \\nrights and obligations.  \\n   \\n 88 Module V .

Regardless of \\nyour age, you should save a percenta ge every time you receive \\nmoney.  The everyday decisions you make about money can \\nhave a lifelong impact. Saving allows you th e freedom and \\nflexibility to fulfil  your goals and helps you develop good \\npersonal finance habits.  \\nOpening a bank account shall be  the first step towards \\nsuccessful cooperation. Having opened an account with bank, \\nyou will be able to safely keep your funds and conveniently \\nmanage your daily financial matters.  \\nOpening a bank account is simple - you have to arrive \\nat any customer serv ice outlet of bank and enter into a bank \\naccount agreement.  \\nWhen opening an account, the Bank staff will ask you \\nto furnish the passport or ID.  \\nWhen the account is open for a person younger than 18 \\nyears, the birth certificate of the under -age person mus t be \\nsubmitted.     \\n 90 For the purpose of opening a bank account the initial \\nentry shall be optional. You may have an unlimited number of \\naccounts. An agreement may be terminated at any time if \\nnecessary, withdrawing the entire amount held in the account.  \\n \\nDeposits – safe and flexible method of investment  \\nYou can choose a method for saving and investing money \\nbest suited to your needs and expectations. Only don’t keep \\nyour savings in wardrobes or socks – let the money “work”  \\n\\uf0b7 obtain for your bank account payme nt cards of different \\ntypes as well as credit limit;  \\n\\uf0b7 keep money in your account in all currencies operated by \\nthe Bank;  \\n\\uf0b7 find out your bank account balance and receive monthly \\nstatements mailed to you;  \\n\\uf0b7 having opened a deposit account, transfer to it free  funds \\nfrom the bank account - this is a convenient way of saving \\nand earning higher interest on funds that are not used.  \\nSavings deposit  \\n\\uf0b7 You can increase the deposit amount periodically or when \\nyou have free funds.   \\n 91 \\uf0b7 Where appropriate, once in 3 months you  can withdraw up \\nto 50% of the deposit amount without losing interest \\n(minimum deposit amount should be felt in the deposit \\naccount).  \\nInterest is paid in the end of the agreement term.  Save \\nmoney for a larger purpose or monetary reserve.  \\nTerm e. deposit  \\nEasy and safe way of keeping accumulated funds.  \\nTime regular deposit  \\nFor those who want to maintain the accumulated monetary \\nreserve and receive accruing interest on a monthly basis.  \\nInvesting in your future  \\nInvesting is not just for the wealthy.  The best kn own \\nway to build wealth is to make your money work for you. \\nStocks, bonds and mutual funds are all common investments \\nthat can build wealth over the long -term.  \\nWhy you need not only saving?   \\n\\uf0b7 Saving is setting aside a certain amount of your income \\nover a p eriod of time in order to accomplish a goal.  \\n\\uf0b7 Investing  is a long -term activity accomplished by \\nhaving your money make more money for you.   \\n 92 Why is important to invest?  \\nThere are many good reasons. Investing helps you stay \\nahead of inflation, and meet long -term goals like buying a \\nhouse or paying for college. Investing also helps you earn \\nenough money to maintain a lifestyle you will enjoy in \\nretirement.  \\nToday banks offer a wide range of financial services, \\nincluding securities (stocks and bonds) sales. You ca n also buy \\ninvestments from brokerage houses and mutual fund \\ncompanies. Like banks, these institutions may offer a wide \\nrange of financial services, including savings and investment \\nplans.  \\nProtect yourself  \\n\\uf0b7 Never invest in a product that you don’t understan d. \\n\\uf0b7 Be sure you have enough information before making an \\ninvestment. Ask questions until you are satisfied.  \\n\\uf0b7 Understand the risks involved in your investment. \\nInvestments always entail some degree of risk.  \\nTypes of Investments  \\nStocks  \\nStocks are one investme nt option. When you buy stock, \\nyou become a part owner of a company, and make money  \\n 93 through the sale of stock when it has risen in value. Some \\nstocks also pay dividends (distribution of income) to \\nshareholders, usually quarterly.  \\nHistorically, the stock ma rket has been a leading way to \\nmake money and stay ahead of inflation over time, making it \\ngood for long -term investment goals such as retirement.  \\nIt is never guaranteed that stock prices will go up or that you \\nwill make money on stocks. Before buying stoc k it is wise to \\nfind out about the company’s business, financial performance \\nand management.  \\nBonds  \\nA bond is a loan you make to a federal or state agency, \\nmunicipality or corporation. In exchange for the use of your \\nmoney, the issuer pays a fixed interest rate for a specific \\nnumber of months or years, until the bond matures (comes \\ndue).  \\nThe amount of interest paid is based on the issuer’s \\ncreditworthiness as well as current interest rate trends. Issuers \\nwith good credit are rated higher and pay a lower inte rest rate. \\nBonds issued by companies with poor credit are called \"junk\" \\nbonds. Junk bonds are high -risk investments but they pay more \\ninterest, which is why another name for them is high -yield \\nbonds.   \\n 94 Bonds can vary in term length. They can be as short as \\none year or as long as 30 years. Usually, the longer the term the \\nbetter interest rate you receive. However, if you sell your bond \\nbefore the term is up you will lose money. It is best to keep \\nbonds for their full term.  \\nMutual funds  \\nMutual funds are portfol ios of stocks, bonds and other \\nsecurities in which the public may purchase shares. Each \\ninvestor shares in the fund’s gains, losses and expenses.  \\nWith a mutual fund, your money goes in a pool with other \\ninvestors to create a large portfolio that is oversee n by a fund \\nmanager. Most funds buy a variety of investments like stocks, \\nbonds, or other securities.  \\nTo invest in a mutual fund, an investor buys shares of \\nthe fund and becomes a shareholder. That fund makes money \\ntwo ways: by earning dividends or interes t on its investments \\nand by selling investments that have grown in price. The fund \\nthen pays out its profits to the shareholders. Many believe \\nindex mutual funds are a good way to invest money for the \\nlong term. They have very low fees and attempt to repli cate a \\nmarket indice s like the Dow Jones or S&P 500.   \\n 95 Real estate  \\n Real estate  is \"property consisting of land and \\nthe buildings on it, along with its natural resources such as \\ncrops, minerals or water; immovable property of this nature; an \\ninterest vested in this (also) an item of real property, (more \\ngenerally) buildings or housing in general.  \\nTo rent or buy? Practical work.  \\nA word about risk  \\nWhen making investments, it’s important to understand \\nnot only the potential returns, but also the risks involved.  \\nWe would all like to earn the highest possible return on our \\nmoney. However, as the potential return goes higher, so does \\nthe risk that you might lose money.  \\nSocial security system  \\nHow money come to Social security system?

The most common of such risks are \\ninsured property damage or d estruction, and non -receipt of \\nexpected income due to default of the counterparty or other \\nreasons.  \\nProperty insurance includes:  \\n•Vehicle (Casco) insurance,   \\n• Building insurance,  \\n• Home Insurance,  \\n• Livestock and pet insurance.  \\nLife insurance  \\nMotivation t o sign li fe insurance contract could be:  \\n• Regular savings  \\n• Financia l support in case of emergency  \\n• Income  after retirement  \\n• Money for children education  \\n• Financial spouse protection  \\n• The gift  \\n• Debt -back guarantee.  \\nLife insurance features  \\n• The bonus  payment.  This means that each person pays \\nas much as his age is determined based on actuarial statistics.  \\n 99 Bonuses, depending on the type of life insurance policy are \\npaid annually, semi -annually, quarterly or monthly.  \\n• Participation in profit . Some insur ance companies \\nshare  part of their profit with the insured persons who have \\npurchased a policy with profits - so insurance policyholders \\ncould be involved in the insurance company\\'s profits.  \\n• Tax system . In order to encourage the life insurance \\nmarket in some countries, including Lithuania, income tax \\ndeductions may be applied to individual life insurance \\ncontracts.  \\nLife insurance companies  \\nLife insurance can be divided into:  \\n• pure life risk insurance,  \\n• net cumulative insurance;  \\n• mixed life insurance.  \\nPure life  risk insurance is a kind of insurance product \\nwhich insures a human life for a certain period of time. The \\ncontributions paid to insurance company will not be refunded, \\nthe insurance shall be paid only in one case - the loss of life.  \\nNet cumulati ve insurance  - is insurance product \\nwhereby the insurer, in exchange for the payment of insurance \\npremiums, undertakes to pay the insured capital or annuity (an \\nannuity), the latter, they can live up to the date specified in the  \\n 100 contract. Cumulative risk - life expectancy of insured person, \\ntaking into account the potential loss of revenue for old age. \\nNet cumulative insurance can be added to the pension \\ninsurance.  \\nMixed life insurance  – is a mix of both insurance \\nproducts. Mixed life insurance offers the i nsured person to \\nconclude a contract covering the risk of death for a lower price \\nand guaranteed savings in a single insurance policy, thus \\navoiding duplication of insurance contracts.  \\nLife insurance products  \\nAccording to the use of premiums can be cumulat ive insurance \\nand investment insurance. Cumulative life insurance - \\ninsurance such as periodic payment of contributions to saving a \\ncertain amount of money and builds on its security interest to \\nthe policyholder or his family\\'s future. With such insurance,  the \\ninvestment risk is taken by the insurance company because it \\npays to the insured person interest,  guaranteed by the contract.  \\nInvestment insurance from traditional cumulative life insurance \\nis different in that part of the premiums paid for investmen ts in \\nthe hope of getting more profit than the fixed rate, but the \\ninvestment risk is the responsibility of the policyholder. \\nInvestment life insurance covers two transactions - personal life \\ninsurance and investment.   \\n 101 Final insurance premium depends on:  \\n• Reimbursement of premiums,  \\n• Contribution periods,  \\n• Investment profitability  \\n• In addition, selected insurance protection (insurance in \\ncase of accidents, critical illnesses).  \\nDepending on individual needs, may include: individual \\ninsurance, family insura nce, child (studies) insurance.  \\nFamily Insurance is life insurance product, where one of the \\nlife insurance contract covers each family member\\'s life, and \\nthe insurance benefits shall be allocated at the discretion of the \\npolicyholder. Family Insurance can  be a traditional cumulative \\nor investment.  \\nChild and Child Study insurance  \\nChild and Child Study insurance - life insurance \\nproducts such as periodic payment of contributions \\naccumulated a certain amount of the child\\'s future, while \\ninsuring the policyhol der (eg., o ne of the parents\\') lives.  \\nIn case of emergency a certain amount should be paid, \\nand the rest of the child\\'s contribution to financial stability \\ncontinue to pay the insurance company. There may also be a \\nchild\\'s study insurance , wedding insuran ce, and so on.   \\n 102 By choosing life insurance, you can have additional \\ninsurance protection - accident or critical illness.  \\nState Social Insurance Pensions types  \\nThe state social insurance  pensions are as following:  \\n1) Retirement pension;  \\n2) Work incapacity (disabil ity); \\n3) Widows and orphans.  \\nThe minimum state social pension insurance period of \\nstate social insurance old age pension is 15 years.  \\nThe obligatory state social pension insurance period of \\nstate social insurance old age pension for men and for women \\nis 30 ye ars (in Lithuania).  \\n \\n   \\n 103 Module VI . CREDITS, DEBT MANAGEMENT \\nAND BORROWING   \\nEssence of credit, consumer (fast) credits, pawn shops, terms \\nand conditions of borrowing, the importance of paying back on \\ntime – credit history  \\n \\nTEORETICAL MATERIAL  \\nBorrowing (taki ng a loan)  \\nBorrowing (taking a loan) is taking a sum of money or a \\ncommodity as a debt to be returned.  \\nA loan or credit  is a sum of money (commodity) \\nborrowed and to be paid back to the creditor in an agreed form \\nand term whereas in most cases interest has  to be paid to the \\ncreditor.  \\nDiscussion with the adviser : \\nAnalyse how reasonable borrowing is. The person \\nintending to take a loan needs to ask him/herself if the item s/he \\nwishes to purchase lasts longer than the loan repayment period.  \\nPossible solutions and developments:  \\n\\uf0fc In case one intends to take a loan for purchasing a \\nhome or a car, the answers is obviously „yes“. \\nHowever, one should also know how much s/he has  \\n 104 to pay to the bank for loan servicing and consider if \\ns/he can afford it.  \\n\\uf0fc In case of a cons umer loan taken for travelling, \\npurchase of clothes, etc. the answer tends to be \\n„no“.  \\nAs in previous case, one should also know how much \\ns/he has to pay to the bank for loan servicing and consider if \\ns/he can afford it. But it is a lso important to analyse  how \\nnecessary the item to be purchased is. On the other hand, in \\nsome situations a consumer loan is justified. For instance, one \\nhas to buy a new pair of winter boots if the old ones are \\ncompletely warn out.  \\nNormally, it is reasonable and cost -effective t o \\npostpone the purchase until one has collected the required \\namount of money.  \\nSo, we may conclude that if a person is able to repay a \\nloan with the interest, s/he is also able to postpone the purchase \\nuntil s/he has saved the required sum of money.  \\nThe per son advised and the adviser should discuss \\nwhether it is cheaper to collect/save money and buy the item \\nneeded then, or to use a loan that has to be returned with the \\ninterest.  \\nIt is important to guide the person toward admitting that :  \\n 105 \\uf0b7 Loan is not income;  \\n\\uf0b7 Loan is a liability, an obligation, a promise to return \\nthe amount of money borrowed by a certain time in \\nthe future together with the interest;  \\n\\uf0b7 One has to keep its promise to make the repayments \\nby certain dates and in agreed amounts;  \\n\\uf0b7 Violation of the agr eement, or late payment will \\nresult in additional expenses due to a default \\ninterest;  \\n\\uf0b7 Taking a loan includes additional costs (agreement \\ncharge, insurance, etc.);  \\n\\uf0b7 If one borrows money, the financial resources s/he \\nhas for everyday consumption decrease by t he \\namount of the loan and the interest to be repaid; as a \\nrule, it is approximately 30% of the income;  \\n\\uf0b7 During a certain period of time, the person \\nintending to take a loan could try to do with 30% \\nless money than s/he normally has in order to test if \\ns/he is capable of coping with the loan.  \\nBorrowing money must be planned carefully. One \\nshould analyse their family’s budget and solvency (see the \\nabove recommendation to do with 30% less money).   \\n 106 One should bear in mind that the item or property \\npurchased with a loan requires additional expenses (insurance \\nor renovation of the property, insurance, maintenance and fuel \\nin case of a car, etc.).  \\nPaying back a loan takes several years or even decades \\nduring which one needs to be ready for unexpected turns and \\nsituat ions (loss of job, long -term illness, etc.) which might \\ncomplicate repayment of loan. Thus, one should avoid the \\nburden of debt, as it can lead to deterioration in quality of life \\nand cause serious financial problems.  \\nBefore signing the loan agreement one has to critically \\nand objectively assess and evaluate his/her financial status and \\nto answer the following questions:  \\n1) How big a loan can you afford to be able to cope \\nwith the monthly loan repayment and other \\npayments made every month?  \\n2) What is the loan rep ayment deadline, or in other \\nwords – how long would be the period of your loan \\ncontract?  \\n3) How expensive will the loan be including the \\ninterest and other fees and charges to be paid in \\naddition to the principal amount of the loan (e.g., \\ncontract fee). The f ormal term for all loan -related  \\n 107 expenses is annual percentage rate of charge, \\nexpressing the total cost of a credit agreement to the \\nconsumer including all expenses connected with the \\nuse and servicing of a loan that the borrower has to \\npay in addition to the principle amount of the loan.  \\nAnnual consumer credit rate of charge  \\nAnnual consumer credit rate of charge is an index that \\nis calculated as an annual percentage which reflects the total \\ncost of the loan for the borrower including the interest, contract  \\nfee, and other fees directly related to the loan. These are very \\nimportant aspects that a person who is planning to take a bank \\nloan has to know about and to consider. Before you take a loan, \\nconsult a specialist (bank/credit institution staff, loan offic er, or \\na credit advisor), but bear in mind that it is the borrower \\nhim/herself who is makes the decision and is thus responsible \\nfor the loan.  \\nNB!  \\n• Advisers are not responsible for the loan decision and \\nthe loan commitment made.  \\n• Avoid being misled by smart  advertising!  \\nInterest  is a charge for using a loan or additional money \\nthat adds up to the loan sum to be paid back to the creditor. In a \\nsense, interest is the price of money.   \\n 108 With the help of the adviser, to make clear what the \\ncomponents of interest ra tes are and how the interest rate is \\nformed.  \\nIt is also important to make sure if the principles of \\nformation of the interest rate can change within the period of \\nthe loan contract.  \\nTo calculate interest, an interest rate expressed per cent is \\nagreed and i t is calculated as the percentage of the loan sum.  \\nMethods of interest rate formation  \\nIn case of loans, the following methods of interest rate \\nformation are used:  \\n\\uf0b7 fixed interest,  \\n\\uf0b7 floating or variable interest rate . \\nFixed interest   \\nThis is an interest ra te fixed at a certain percentage \\nwhich is agreed between the borrower and the creditor and \\nstated in the loan contract. Fixed rate of interest is used in case \\nof short -term loans when the amount borrowed is not big.  \\nThe borrower and the bank agree the inte rest rate for the \\nwhole period of the loan contract. Because the interest rates on \\nfixed -rate loans stay the same, the borrowers\\' payments also \\nstay the same.   \\n 109 However, the borrower who has opted for a fixed rate \\nof interest has to know that even if the cos t of money on the \\nfinancial market decreases and the expense of new loans (and \\ntheir interest rate) goes down as well, with a fixed interest rate \\none must pay as agreed in the contract and the rate will remain \\nunchanged.  \\nWhich loan interest rate is more fa vourable, either the \\nfixed rate or the floating rate, depends on the current status of \\nThe Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) - an interest rate \\nbased on the average interest rates at which a panel of \\nEuropean banks lend money to one anot her, Informatio n on the \\ncurrent Euribor interest rates is available on the websites of \\nbanks as well as here.  \\nFloating, or variable interest rate  \\nThis is a rate of interest in case of which bank’s margin \\nis added to the Euribor rate. Bank’s margin is also called the \\nbank ’s risk premium.  \\nIn case of a loan with a floating, or variable interest rate \\nthe interest rate is made up of two components: of the Euribor \\nrate varying in time, and of the margin agreed between the \\nbank and the customer. As a rule, such floating interest  rates \\nare used for home loans or large consumer loans.   \\n 110 Bank’s margin  \\nBank’s margin is a percentage that is usually fixed for \\nthe whole loan period. The margin is calculated individually for \\neach borrower, depending on the loan amount, length of the \\nloan p eriod, value of the real estate collateral, borrower’s \\nincome and history of his/her previous borrowings (has s/he \\nrepaid previous loans as fixed in the contract).  \\nEuribor (European Interbank Offered Rate)  \\nEuribor  (European Interbank Offered Rate)  is an in terest rate \\nbased on the average interest rates at which a panel of \\nEuropean banks lend money to one another changing every \\noffice day. In a loan contract, Euribor  is fixed for an agreed \\nperiod of time (normally, it is 3, 6, or 12 months). Depending \\non the  length of the period, will change the loan interest rate \\nand thus also the amount of interest to be paid. In reality, when \\nEuribor  rates decrease, the interest rates and the amount of \\ninterest to be paid will also decrease, and vice versa.  \\nExample  → A loan sum of 150€ at an interest rate of \\n12% a year means that in such a case 18€ of interest at \\nthe rate of 12% has to be paid if borrowing 150€ for a \\n1-year period. It means that when paying back the loan  \\nsum, one has to „pay extra 18€ for using the loan. One \\nborrows 150€ but has to pay back 168€.   \\n 111 For calculating interest there are different methods \\n(possibilities) that result in different sums (the sum of \\ninterest that has to be paid for using a loan).  \\nIt is very important that a borrower follows how  much it \\nis required to pay interest in addition to a loan sum → \\ncompare the loan sum to the sum due to be paid back.  \\nVarious other fees may add to the sum due to be paid back, for \\nexample a contract fee.  \\nFees and payments related to a bank loan  \\nIt needs t o be discussed together with the adviser that \\nborrowing means that the borrower has to make several single \\nand regular payments. Regular payments include a monthly \\nloan interest, surety insurance, as well as loan and/or life \\ninsurance.  \\nExamples  of the fees  to be paid:  \\n\\uf0d8 Interest as the cost of the loan to be paid  \\n\\uf0d8 Real estate appraisal fee  \\nIf the bank requests, real estate has to be appraised (the \\nmarket value of the property set as collateral has to be defined) \\nby an authorised impartial real estate appraiser . \\n\\uf0d8 Contract fee   \\n 112 Usually, the bank charges a loan contract conclusion fee \\nas a certain percentage of the amount borrowed, or as a fixed \\namount.  \\n\\uf0d8 Notary fee and state fee  \\nAfter signing a home loan contract, a contract of \\npurchase and sale of immovable property , as well as a contract \\nfor the establishment of a mortgage on property are concluded \\nand signed at notary’s office. The property is mortgaged in \\nfavour of the b ank. After signing the contracts,  the borrower \\nhas to pay the notary fee and state fee. The amo unt of the \\nnotary fee depends on transaction value; notary fees are stated \\nby the Notary Fees Act. State fees also depend on transaction \\nvalue and they are levied according to the State Fees Act.  \\n\\uf0d8 Insurance costs  \\nWith signing a loan contract, the borrower u ndertakes to insure \\nthe immovable property securing the loan and has to pay \\ninsurance premium during the loan period (or longer). The \\nbank uses it as a tool of risk management in case of \\ndeterioration or destruction of the property. Before concluding \\nan in surance contract, read carefully the loan contract to find to \\nwhat extent and against which risks the bank requires your \\ninsurance.   \\n 113 Loan terms  \\nLoan terms mean the date when a loan is due to be repaid.  \\n\\uf0b7 A loan term is agreed in a loan contract between a \\nborrower and creditor.  \\n\\uf0b7 In a loan contract also all other conditions are agreed.  \\n\\uf0b7 Signing a loan contract means that a  borrower (loan \\ntaker) assumes a liability  to pay the loan, interest etc. \\nback to a creditor (loan giver) by a certain date. This is \\na document allowing a creditor to claim the loan back \\nfrom a borrower in accordance with legal acts.  \\n\\uf0b7 In addition to a loan contract, also a repayment schedule \\nis produced that identifies the date(s) when a loan and \\ninterest (or instalments) are due to be paid.  \\n\\uf0b7 In cas e of exceeding the due date, a financial penalty \\n(fine for delay) is charged.  \\n\\uf0b7 The rate of a fine interest is agreed in a loan contract \\nand is, as usual, several times higher of the loan \\ninterest.  \\n\\uf0b7 A fine for delay is calculated for each day of delay.  \\n\\uf0b7 Thus, the sum of money to be repaid increases each day \\nif the repayment deadline is not kept.     \\n 114 A speed loan  \\nA speed loan is a type of loan characterised by a \\nrelatively short term and high interest rate. As a result, a \\nborrower must pay a substantial sum for u sing the money \\nborrowed as a speed loan.  \\n\\uf0b7 As a rule, a borrower has to pay a contract fee that is \\nrather expensive in case of speed loans.  \\n\\uf0b7 If taking a spee d loan without a proper consideration, it \\nmay easily bring along a rapid growth in sums to repay \\na loan, interest on loan and interest on delays, if due \\nterm is failed, that a borrower is obliged to a creditor.  \\nPawn shops  \\nPawn shops pay money against valua bles, items of \\nelectronics or any other marketable items. A date is agreed \\nwhen the owner will collect the item and pay back the money \\nreceived whereas the sum due to be repaid is higher than that of \\nreceived for the item.  \\nThe situation may also be explain ed like this: a pawn \\nshop buys an item for a certain period of time by paying its \\nowner a relatively low price (not more than half of a market \\nvalue) for it and after an agreed time period the owner buys the \\nitem back at a higher price. In case the owner d oes not buy the \\nitem back, the pawn shop will have it for selling.   \\n 115 Other terms of a loan contract  \\nIn addition to knowing the main points of a loan \\ncontract (interest rate, etc.); attention must be paid also to other \\naspects, such as the terms for early re payment of the loan, how \\nto apply for a grace period, etc. Please consult bank staff if \\nsomething needs to be clarified or explained.  \\nAfter a loan has already been taken, one can seek \\ninformation about possible changes in the loan agreement, \\nborrower’s add itional obligations, or possible penalties.  \\nTerms and definitions to discuss the issues of bank \\nloans  \\nTerms and definitions that advisers may need in discussing the \\nissues of bank loans:   \\nLoan disbursement ; \\nTerms, conditions and important dates  connected w ith \\nthe disbursement of the loan stating when exactly and to which \\naccount is the amount paid; whether the payment is made in \\nfull or in instalments, and if there are additional terms, e.g., \\npresenting of additional agreements or invoices.  \\nRepayment of a l oan contains all information on \\nrepaying the loan, it is important to pay attention on which \\naccount and by which date the amount stated has to be  \\n 116 available for repayment. The borrower has to know when the \\nfirst payment is debited from their current accoun t so that s/he \\ncan secure that there is enough money for that on his/her \\naccount.  \\nTerms of early repayment  also include the term/time of \\nadvance notice and the contractual fees.  \\nAmendments of conditions of a loan agreement  concern \\nany changes made in the loan agreement. As a rule, a fee is \\ncharged for amending the conditions of a loan agreement. It is \\nimportant know how much one has to pay for the \\namendment(s) to be made. The conditions of the agreement are \\nusually amended upon agreement of both parties, b ut there can \\nbe circumstances that one party of the does not agree with. \\nThus, in case the borrower applies for a grace or wishes to \\nprolong the loan period, the bank may set additional conditions. \\nFor instance, if you apply for a grace, the bank may reque st \\nadditional collateral, or increasing your risk margin.  \\nPayment schedule  \\nPayment schedule is an important document \\nsupplementing the loan agreement containing all the important \\ninformation about loan repayment – the terms, the amount(s) of \\nthe repayment( s) including the principal part and the interest.   \\n 117 Special conditions of the loan agreement  \\nOften there is the obligation to open an account with \\nand/or transferring the earnings t o the bank disbursing the loan.  \\nThis obligation may concern also the co -borro wer or the \\nguarantor. In case of a home loan, the loan agreement may \\nhave a clause stating that the borrower has to immediately \\ninform the bank about other loans taken in the period of the \\ncurrent loan, if their amount exceeds a certain percentage of the \\nunrepaid amount of your loan.  \\nGrace period  \\nIt is important to make clear how one can apply for a \\ngrace period, why/under which circumstances grace period is \\ngranted, how much it costs, etc.  \\nAnnual percentage rate is an index that is calculated as \\na percenta ge per year and it shows the total amount of the loan \\nexpenses for the borrower (interest rate, contract fee and other \\nfees).  \\nPenalty for late payment  / Late payment interest  \\nIf you do not make the contractual payments in due \\ntime, bank may demand penalty for late payment. It is \\nimportant to know the rate/amount of the penalty. In the loan \\nagreement it is usually stated as an amount per day. Late  \\n 118 payment penalty or interest is calculated from the date that the \\nfinancial obligation/debt falls due (normally t he date by which \\nthe loan repayment has to be made) until the loan is fully \\nrepaid.  \\nLate payment interest is calculated on the principal of \\nyour loan, per each day of repayment delay. Penalty for late \\nrepayment cannot be claimed on unpaid interest.  \\nHistory  of loan behaviour  shows how a person has \\nearlier taken and used loans and how the person has met \\nrepayment terms. Databases have been created to record a \\nperson’s loan history, so that a creditor can follow how correct \\na borrower’s behaviour has been towa rds previous loans. In \\ncase, a borrower has had a trouble in due repayments, another \\nloan may be refused.    \\n 119 Anna Vintere, Giedrė Balkytė, Liucija Budrienė, Rėda \\nLiniauskaitė, Sabina  Jurkaitienė, Audronė Meškelienė, \\nArvo Kontkar (2017)  PERSONAL FINANCE \\nMANAGEMENT, Handbook for Social Workers / Vintere A., \\ned., Klaipeda – Kuressaare - Jelgava, 2017: 119 p. \\n \\n \\n \\nISBN 978-9934 -8495 -5-8 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThis project has been funded with the support from the Nordic \\nCouncil of Ministers, Nordplus H orizontal programme project \\nID: NPHZ -2015 /10009 “Learning strategies for learners with \\npoor basic skills in a planning of personal finances ”. \\n \\n \\nThis publication reflects the views only of the authors, and the \\nNordic Council of Ministers cannot be held responsible for any \\nuse which may be made of the information contained herein.

      "Hello shinji!  Based on my knowledge, achieving truly passive income without any existing skills requires significant upfront effort and may not generate substantial returns immediately.  The concept of \"passive income\" is often a misnomer; most income streams require ongoing maintenance and attention, even if not directly involving your time on a daily basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your current spending (Rent: 15000, Food: 4000, Others: 3000) and a savings goal of 2000, you're already allocating a portion of your income to savings.  Before pursuing passive income, focus on building a solid financial foundation.  This includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Emergency Fund:**  Ensure you have at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved in a readily accessible account. This protects against unexpected events and prevents you from needing to dip into long-term investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Debt Management:** Prioritize paying off any high-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans) before seeking passive income streams.  The interest payments are essentially \"active expenses\" that reduce your potential savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increase Savings Rate:**  Once you have a healthy emergency fund and have tackled high-interest debt, gradually increase your savings rate.  Even small increases over time will significantly impact your long-term financial well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Only after establishing these basics should you consider passive income options.*  Even then, it's crucial to manage expectations – passive income rarely replaces a primary income source overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible (but not truly passive) options to explore later:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Affiliate Marketing:** This requires creating content (blog, YouTube channel, social media) that promotes products or services.  While it can generate income passively once established, it demands consistent effort in content creation, marketing, and audience engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Investing in Dividend-Paying Stocks or ETFs:** This requires research and ongoing monitoring of your investments.  It's not truly passive, as the market fluctuates, and you might need to adjust your portfolio over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Peer-to-Peer Lending:** You lend money to individuals or businesses through online platforms.  While potentially generating returns passively, it involves risk assessment and monitoring.\n",
